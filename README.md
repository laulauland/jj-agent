# jj-agent

A jj-first coding agent that uses Jujutsu version control as its primary workflow mechanism.

## Overview

jj-agent is an experimental coding agent designed to leverage the power of [Jujutsu (jj)](https://github.com/martinvonz/jj), a Git-compatible version control system. Unlike traditional coding agents that treat version control as an afterthought, jj-agent embraces Jujutsu's workflow as a core mechanism for managing code changes, experimentation, and collaboration.

## Key Features

- **Jujutsu-First Workflow**: Built from the ground up to work with jj's powerful change-centric model
- **Intelligent Change Management**: Leverage jj's ability to easily manipulate and organize changes
- **Parallel Experimentation**: Use jj's branching model to explore multiple solutions simultaneously
- **Safe Operations**: Take advantage of jj's conflict resolution and undo capabilities
